# Plant-Disease-Detection

This repository hosts a plant disease detection system utilizing the EfficientNet-B0 algorithm. The project focuses on identifying and monitoring leaf diseases in major crops such as rice and wheat. Employing machine learning techniques, the system aids precision agriculture by providing early disease detection and management insights for farmers, ultimately optimizing crop yield and sustainability.
