# Crop-Disease-Monitoring

This repository hosts a plant disease detection system utilizing the EfficientNet-B0 algorithm. The project focuses on identifying and monitoring leaf diseases in major crops such as rice and wheat. Employing machine learning techniques, the system aids precision agriculture by providing early disease detection and management insights for farmers, ultimately optimizing crop yield and sustainability.

Key Features:

EfficientNet-B0 architecture for accurate and resource-efficient leaf disease identification.
Incorporates data augmentation techniques for enhanced model robustness and adaptability.
Real-time monitoring capabilities enable proactive disease management.
Easily extensible to other crops, ensuring versatility and adaptability.
Encourages continuous improvement through collaborative efforts and innovative exploration.

Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Explore the Jupyter notebook Plant_Disease_Detection.ipynb for a detailed walkthrough of the project, including model training and evaluation.
The trained model is saved as Plant_Disease_Model.h5 for direct usage or integration into other applications.
